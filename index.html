        <h2>SABO</h2>
        <img src="./3706967457.webp" height="150" alt="sabo">
        <p>Sabo is the chief of staff of the Revolutionary Army, recognized as "No. 2" of the entire organization, ranking directly below Monkey D. Dragon.</p>
    

    <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>At a very young age, Sabo ran away from his noble parents in the Goa Kingdom to live alone in the Gray Terminal, kingdom, and he met and befriended Ace not long after. </p> <p>Five years later (12 before the current storyline), the two became friends with Luffy as well, and the three consider themselves "brothers", swearing a brotherhood for sake. They also share a dream of setting out to sea as pirates and achieving freedom, Sabo originally planned to do so at the age of 17.</p>
        <p>However, after escaping his parents once again not long after they captured him and took him away from his adopted brother, Sabo then set sail on his own, but his ship was destroyed by a Heavenly Dragon moments later.</p>
        <p>Because he was believed to have died during this incident, Sabo actually survived because Dragon saved him, and thus he joined the Revolutionaries. He has lost most of his memories since then but returned after learning of Ace's death at Marineford. He currently has a bounty of 602,000,000 Berries.</p>
